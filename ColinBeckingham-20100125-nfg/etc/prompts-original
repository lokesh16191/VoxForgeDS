a0191 For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone. 
a0192 He did not rush in. 
a0193 It was edged with ice. 
a0194 He drank of the water cautiously. 
a0195 But a strange thing happened. 
a0196 He began to follow the footprints of the dog. 
a0197 Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose. 
a0198 Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions. 
a0199 Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day. 
a0200 He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
