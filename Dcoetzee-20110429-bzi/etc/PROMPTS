Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0513 WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES AND NOT OUR MONEY ALONE
Dcoetzee-20110429-bzi/mfc/a0514 WE ARE CONSUMED IN OUR OWN FLESH-POTS
