rb-01 Hand-held devices such as personal digital assistants and smartphones are quite small. 
rb-02 Most of them use either a touch screen interface or a miniaturized keyboard for user input. 
rb-03 Built-in keyboards are usually operated with the thumbs, since touch typing and 
rb-04 hunt and peck typing using the fingers are pretty much out of the question. 
rb-05 Devices with a touch screen interface often use an on-screen keyboard, or handwriting 
rb-06 recognition for inputting text. This has a couple of drawbacks.

rb-08 the amount of available "screen real-estate". 
rb-09 On top of that thumbing or thumb typing puts a lot of strain on the thumb, 
rb-10 which is not as dexterous as the fingers are.
