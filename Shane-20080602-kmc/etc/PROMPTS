Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
Shane-20080602-kmc/mfc/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
