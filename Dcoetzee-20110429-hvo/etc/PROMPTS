Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0428 THE HISTORY OF OUR WESTWARD-FARING RACE IS WRITTEN IN IT
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0429 AND THE EURASIAN CHINESE-ENGLISHMAN BOWED HIMSELF AWAY
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0430 THEY WERE BABBLING AND CHATTERING ALL TOGETHER
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0431 TOO MUCH HE TOLD ME WITH OMINOUS ROLLING HEAD
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
Dcoetzee-20110429-hvo/mfc/b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
