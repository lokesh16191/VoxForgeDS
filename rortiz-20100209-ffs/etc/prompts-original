rb-15 One way to deal with this is to use only a limited number of available commands. 
rb-16 That way the software only needs to compare 
rb-17 the voice input with a small number of possible options. 
rb-18 Modern computers have far more computing power than hand-held devices. 
rb-19 That means that when a programmer wants to write speech recognition software, 
rb-20 it is necessary to keep in mind on which hardware the software will run. 
rb-21 A full-blown computer offers a programmer the freedom to develop software 
rb-22 that allows the end user to issue a wider array of commands. 
rb-23 In practice this will allow end users to issue commands such as "go to previous paragraph" 
rb-24 "go up one paragraph" or even "I want to edit the previous paragraph".
