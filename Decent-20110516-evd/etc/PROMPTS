Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0286 THE TIME WAS CONSIDERED AUSPICIOUS
Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0287 OR HAVE THEY ALREADY DEVISED ONE
Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC

Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN

Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
Decent-20110516-evd/mfc/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
