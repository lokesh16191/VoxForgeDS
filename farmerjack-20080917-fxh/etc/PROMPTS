farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST

farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
farmerjack-20080917-fxh/mfc/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
