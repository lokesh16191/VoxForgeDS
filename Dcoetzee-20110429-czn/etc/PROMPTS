Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0036 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0037 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
Dcoetzee-20110429-czn/mfc/a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
