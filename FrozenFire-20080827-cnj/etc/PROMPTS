FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
FrozenFire-20080827-cnj/mfc/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
