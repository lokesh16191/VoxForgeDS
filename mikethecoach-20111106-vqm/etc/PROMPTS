mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
mikethecoach-20111106-vqm/mfc/a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
