glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0135 IN IT WAS THE JOY OF LIFE
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0136 SWIFTLY HIS EYES MEASURED THE SITUATION
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0137 BUT THIS LITTLE DEFECT DID NOT WORRY HIM
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0138 AND THEN STEADILY HE BEGAN TO CHEW
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0139 TOGETHER THEY ATE THE RABBIT
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0140 THEY EDGED NEARER AND STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THEIR WORLD
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0141 IT WAS BEATING AND WAITING IN THE AMBUSH OF THOSE BLACK PITS
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
glenton-20090924-qpb/mfc/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
