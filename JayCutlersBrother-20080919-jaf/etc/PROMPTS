JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
JayCutlersBrother-20080919-jaf/mfc/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
