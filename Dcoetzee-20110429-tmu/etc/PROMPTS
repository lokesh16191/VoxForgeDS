Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
Dcoetzee-20110429-tmu/mfc/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
