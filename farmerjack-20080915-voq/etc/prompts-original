rb-06 recognition for inputting text. This has a couple of drawbacks. 
rb-07 The keyboard, whether it's an on-screen version or not, strongly reduces 
rb-08 the amount of available "screen real-estate". 
rb-09 On top of that thumbing or thumb typing puts a lot of strain on the thumb, 
rb-10 which is not as dexterous as the fingers are. 
rb-11 A good solution would be to use speech recognition, 
rb-12 especially since most of these devices often already have a built-in microphone. 
rb-13 Many phones already offer the possibility of so-called voice dialing. 
rb-14 A major stumbling block is the still limited computing power of these phones. 
rb-15 One way to deal with this is to use only a limited number of available commands.
