tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
tomhannen-20080411-epi/mfc/a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
