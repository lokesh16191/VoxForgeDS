akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
akiplaner-20110929-lbm/mfc/a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
