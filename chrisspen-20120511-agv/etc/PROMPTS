chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0104 SHOOTING PAINS PASSED LIKE FLASHES OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY
chrisspen-20120511-agv/mfc/b0105 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE THERE AND JEANNE KNOWS
