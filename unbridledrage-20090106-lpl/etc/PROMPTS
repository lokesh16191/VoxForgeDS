unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/mfc/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/mfc/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/mfc/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
unbridledrage-20090106-lpl/mfc/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
