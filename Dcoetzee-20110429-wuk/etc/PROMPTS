Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0128 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0129 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0130 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0131 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0132 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0133 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
Dcoetzee-20110429-wuk/mfc/a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
